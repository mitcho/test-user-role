Quickly test other user roles from a super admin account, to see what other users experience.

== Description ==

This plugin lets super admins quickly test other user roles, to see what other users experience.

* Super admins get a Test User Role menu under the Howdy menu.
* Roles being tested will be reset on user login or logout.

**Warning:** When a role is being tested, the user role in the database is actually modified. Note also that the `set_user_role` action is fired when going in and out of testing.
